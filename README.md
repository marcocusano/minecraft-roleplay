# Minecraft Roleplay
The definitive guide to host and code your own Minecraft Roleplay Server!
Follow this guide to start a new self-configured Minecraft Server and a self-hosted Web Application.
Please do not edit the code if you're not prepared to debug it by yourself.
This Repo was made to self-host a working end-user project. If you find a bug from an existing feature you're free to open a pull request or contact me at [report@marcocusano.dev](mailto:report@marcocusano.dev)

**Do not ask for support if you edit the code of your own, breaking everything cuz you're a PiZza ChatGPTer**.\
**That's a free project and you're free to use as free to leave! Don't you think so?**
